# Toolhub App

Toolhub is a community-driven tool lending/borrowing app designed to facilitate efficient exchange among users. Developed as a group project during the capstone phase at WeCanCodeIt (WCCI), with leadership provided by myself, Toolhub provides a platform for users to borrow and lend tools within their local communities.
